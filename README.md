# Rock-Paper-Scissors
rock paper scissors game on javascript

Solution: At first console.log was not working to show whether the player won or the computer. After many trials, I tried using If statement instead of switch statement and using a single playGame() function with playRound(), playerChoice, computerChoice inside it, and it worked!
